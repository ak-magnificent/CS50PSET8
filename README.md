CS50 Problem Set 8
-Contain at least four different .html pages, at least one of which is index.html (the main page of your website), and it should be possible to get from any page on your website to any other page by following one or more hyperlinks.
-Use at least ten (10) distinct HTML tags besides <html>, <head>, <body>, and <title>. Using some tag (e.g., <p>) multiple times still counts as just one (1) of those ten!
